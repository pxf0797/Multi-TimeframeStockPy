# Multi-Timeframe Quantitative Trading Strategy: Model Structure and Module Relationships

## 1. Overall Structure

The multi-timeframe quantitative trading strategy consists of several interconnected modules that work together to process data, generate predictions, and execute trading decisions. The main components of the system are:

1. Data Acquisition
2. Feature Engineering
3. LSTM Model
4. Dynamic Weight Module
5. Signal Generation
6. Backtesting

These components are orchestrated by the main script, which ties everything together and executes the strategy.

## 2. Module Descriptions and Relationships

### 2.1 Data Acquisition (Data/data_acquisition.py)

This module is responsible for fetching historical stock data across multiple timeframes.

Key features:
- Uses the `yfinance` library to fetch data
- Supports multiple timeframes (e.g., "1d", "1wk", "1mo")
- Aligns data across different timeframes

Relationship:
- Provides data to the Feature Engineering module

### 2.2 Feature Engineering (Model/main.py)

While not a separate module, feature engineering is performed within the `MultiTimeframeTrader` class in the main script.

Key features:
- Calculates technical indicators (RSI, moving averages, volatility)
- Prepares data for input into the LSTM model

Relationship:
- Receives raw data from Data Acquisition
- Feeds processed data to the LSTM Model

### 2.3 LSTM Model (Model/lstm_model.py)

This module defines the core neural network architecture used for prediction.

Key components:
- `LSTMModel`: A single LSTM model for one timeframe
- `MultiTimeframeLSTM`: Combines multiple LSTM models for different timeframes

Relationship:
- Receives processed data from Feature Engineering
- Outputs predictions to the Dynamic Weight Module

### 2.4 Dynamic Weight Module (Model/dynamic_weight.py)

This module adjusts the importance of predictions from different timeframes.

Key components:
- `DynamicWeightModule`: Neural network for dynamic weight calculation
- `calculate_dynamic_weight`: Function for weight calculation
- `generate_signal`: Function to produce final trading signals

Relationship:
- Receives LSTM outputs and additional metrics
- Provides weighted outputs to Signal Generation

### 2.5 Signal Generation (Model/main.py)

Implemented within the `MultiTimeframeTrader` class in the main script, this component generates trading signals based on model outputs and technical indicators.

Key features:
- Combines LSTM predictions with traditional technical analysis
- Generates buy/sell signals and determines position sizes

Relationship:
- Receives weighted outputs from Dynamic Weight Module
- Feeds trading signals to the Backtesting module

### 2.6 Backtesting (Model/backtesting.py)

This module evaluates the performance of the trading strategy.

Key components:
- `Backtester`: Class for running backtests
- `run_backtest`: Function to execute the backtest and calculate performance metrics

Relationship:
- Receives trading signals from Signal Generation
- Outputs performance metrics and equity curve

### 2.7 Main Script (Model/main.py)

The main script orchestrates the entire process and ties all modules together.

Key components:
- `MultiTimeframeTrader`: Main class that encapsulates the entire trading strategy
- `main`: Function to run the complete strategy

Relationships:
- Initializes and coordinates all other modules
- Handles the flow of data and control between modules

## 3. Data Flow

1. Raw stock data → Data Acquisition
2. Data Acquisition → Feature Engineering
3. Feature Engineering → LSTM Model
4. LSTM Model → Dynamic Weight Module
5. Dynamic Weight Module → Signal Generation
6. Signal Generation → Backtesting
7. Backtesting → Performance Metrics and Visualizations

## 4. Execution Flow

1. Main script initializes `MultiTimeframeTrader`
2. Data is acquired and processed
3. LSTM model generates predictions
4. Dynamic weights are calculated
5. Trading signals are generated
6. Backtest is run to evaluate strategy performance
7. Results are visualized and performance metrics are reported

## 5. Customization Points

The modular structure allows for easy customization:

1. Data Acquisition: Add new data sources or timeframes
2. Feature Engineering: Implement new technical indicators or features
3. LSTM Model: Modify the neural network architecture
4. Dynamic Weight Module: Adjust the weighting mechanism
5. Signal Generation: Refine the signal generation logic
6. Backtesting: Modify performance metrics or risk management rules

## 6. Future Enhancements

The current structure provides a solid foundation for future improvements:

1. Implement proper LSTM model training with data splitting and validation
2. Add more sophisticated exit strategies in the Signal Generation module
3. Incorporate additional data sources (e.g., fundamental data, sentiment analysis) in Data Acquisition
4. Implement online learning capabilities for continuous model updating
5. Add a live trading module for real-time execution of the strategy

This modular and extensible design allows for continuous improvement and adaptation of the trading strategy to changing market conditions.
