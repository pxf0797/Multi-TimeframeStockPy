# Multi-Timeframe Quantitative Trading Strategy User Manual

## 1. System Overview

This multi-timeframe quantitative trading strategy is designed to analyze stock data across multiple timeframes (daily, weekly, and monthly) using a combination of LSTM neural networks and traditional technical indicators. The system includes modules for data acquisition, feature engineering, model training, signal generation, and backtesting.

## 2. Installation and Setup

### 2.1 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### 2.2 Installing Dependencies

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the required packages by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Data Acquisition

The system uses the `yfinance` library to fetch stock data. To acquire data:

1. Open `Data/data_acquisition.py`.
2. Modify the `symbol`, `timeframes`, `start_date`, and `end_date` variables in the `__main__` section:

```python
symbol = "MSFT"  # Change this to your desired stock symbol
timeframes = ["1d", "1wk", "1mo"]
start_date = "2022-01-01"
end_date = "2023-12-31"
```

3. Run the script:

```
python Data/data_acquisition.py
```

This will fetch the data and store it in memory. In a production environment, you might want to save this data to a database or file system for persistence.

## 4. Model Training

The current implementation uses a placeholder for model training. To implement actual training:

1. Open `Model/lstm_model.py`.
2. Modify the `MultiTimeframeLSTM` class to include a training method:

```python
def train(self, data_list, epochs=100, batch_size=32):
    # Implement your training logic here
    # This should include:
    # - Splitting data into training and validation sets
    # - Creating DataLoader objects
    # - Defining loss function and optimizer
    # - Training loop (forward pass, backward pass, optimization)
    # - Validation
    pass
```

3. In `Model/main.py`, update the `train_model` method of the `MultiTimeframeTrader` class:

```python
def train_model(self, data_list):
    print("Training model...")
    self.lstm_model.train(data_list)
    print("Model training complete")
```

4. To train the model, run:

```
python Model/main.py
```

## 5. Running the Strategy

To run the complete strategy, including backtesting:

1. Open `Model/main.py`.
2. Modify the `symbol`, `timeframes`, `start_date`, and `end_date` variables in the `main` function:

```python
symbol = "MSFT"  # Change this to your desired stock symbol
timeframes = ["1d", "1wk", "1mo"]
start_date = "2022-01-01"
end_date = "2023-12-31"
```

3. Run the script:

```
python Model/main.py
```

This will execute the entire process: data acquisition, feature engineering, model training (currently a placeholder), signal generation, and backtesting.

## 6. Interpreting Results

After running the strategy, you'll see several outputs:

1. Console output with performance metrics:
   - Number of buy and sell signals
   - Win rate
   - Total return
   - Sharpe ratio
   - Max drawdown

2. Generated plots:
   - `trading_signals_[SYMBOL].png`: Shows the stock price and generated trading signals
   - `multi_timeframe_data_[SYMBOL].png`: Displays data across different timeframes
   - `equity_curve_[SYMBOL].png`: Shows the equity curve of the strategy

Review these outputs to assess the performance of your strategy.

## 7. Customizing the Strategy

To customize the strategy:

1. Modify feature engineering in `MultiTimeframeTrader.prepare_data()` in `Model/main.py`.
2. Adjust the LSTM model architecture in `Model/lstm_model.py`.
3. Change the signal generation logic in `MultiTimeframeTrader.generate_trading_signals()` in `Model/main.py`.
4. Modify the backtesting parameters in `Model/backtesting.py`.

## 8. Next Steps

To improve the strategy:

1. Implement proper LSTM model training with data splitting, batching, and validation.
2. Experiment with different features and technical indicators.
3. Implement a more sophisticated exit strategy.
4. Explore different position sizing methods.
5. Implement cross-validation to ensure robustness.

Remember to always validate your changes through backtesting before using the strategy with real money.
